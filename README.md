# UnityVR-Shooter
Shooting game in Unity in VR compatible with Oculus RIft and Oculus quest
You need to have Oculus Rift or Quest Devices setup for the game to function properly
However, you can play the game without VR if you remove *OVR CAMERA RIG MODUEL* or *DELETE* the Oculus Folder from -
the Asset folder.
